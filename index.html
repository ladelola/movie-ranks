        <p>Hijack has left me spellbound, eagerly awaiting each new episode with bated breath. Not since the days of

            Imagine being an ardent fan of certain creative elements🏆 in the universe (Thalapathy Vijay, Venkat Prabhu
            Direction🌟, Yuvan’s Musical & then finally CSK & none other than Thala Dhoni). Now imagine a creation🤔
            where you get to see a combo of all that you are crazy about, probably from CHILDHOOD.. Fine! Keep your
            whistles ready & let’s DIVE IN😃 </p>
